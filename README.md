## Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

### Data for the project
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Files included
1. `run_analysis.R` R script for performing the analysis that does the folloing
     * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
     * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
     * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
     * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
     * From the data set in a previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2. `CodeBook.md` a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data.
3. `TidyData.txt` a final tidy data set created in the last step of the instructions.
